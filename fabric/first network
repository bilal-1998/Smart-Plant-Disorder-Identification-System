Inside The Project directory there is a fabric directory there is first network directory.
All the other directories are required binaries for fabric.

Now open First network directory.
It is the same first network from the one that is present in fabric Samples But I have Modified it.

In First Network these are all docker files for docker to know how and what containers to create.

In base directory the file present show the peer configuration the orderer and ca.

there are two files in the first network cypto-config.yaml and configtx in which it is defined how many organizations are there in the network how many peers per orgs are there.

byfn.sh is a script file which runs all the other files.

docker-compose-couch.yaml file is for couchdb instances and similarly rest of the files server other purposes.like kafka multiple orgs etc.
